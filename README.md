# Dormouse

Building CMS's should be easier!

ActiveRecord models know just about every thing of your data. This means that we can and should use this knowledge in our controllers and views. In fact we can automatically build our controllers and views at runtime if we follow RESTful principles. This is exactly what Dormouse is good at, building controllers and views so we don't have to.

Dormouse provides a simple DSL (see `Dormouse::DSL`) for configuring the controllers and views.
